# Fruit-Data-Analysis-using-One-drive
🚀 Power BI Project Showcase | Fruit Sales Analytics Dashboard 🍎📊

I’m excited to share a recent Power BI end-to-end analytics project I’ve been working on, focused on analyzing fruit sales performance across customers, stores, products, brands, and time.

🔹 What I worked on:

Designed a Snowflake Schema data model with fact and multiple dimension tables (Customer, Store, Product, Category, Brand)

Built a clean and scalable data model optimized for performance

Connected and refreshed data directly from Excel files stored in OneDrive

Created interactive dashboards using:

Dynamic slicers (Customer, Brand, Category, Product, Store, Date)

Bookmarks to switch seamlessly between Total Sales and Average Sales views

Running totals, YTD analysis, and time-based trends

Developed clear, business-friendly visuals for:

Sales by year & month

Average sales by customers

Top stores by sales

Running totals over time

🔹 Key skills demonstrated:
✔ Power BI (Data Modeling, DAX, Visual Design)
✔ Snowflake Schema & dimensional modeling
✔ OneDrive / SharePoint data integration
✔ Bookmarks & report navigation
✔ Business-focused data storytelling

This project strengthened my understanding of how good data modeling directly impacts insight quality and report usability, especially when building dashboards meant for real business users.

I’d love to hear your thoughts or suggestions for improvement — feedback is always welcome! 😊
